# Switch Multi-Query Attention Transformer

This repository contains an implementation of a Transformer model with a novel Switch Multi-Query Attention mechanism. This architecture is designed to efficiently handle large-scale attention tasks by routing tokens to a subset of attention experts, optimizing both computational resources and model performance.

## Overview

The Switch Multi-Query Attention Transformer is an advanced neural network model that leverages a mixture-of-experts approach to improve the efficiency and scalability of attention mechanisms. It is particularly suited for tasks involving large sequences and complex attention patterns.

## Features

- **Multi-Query Attention**: Efficiently projects queries into multiple heads while sharing keys and values across heads.
- **Switch Mechanism**: Routes tokens to a subset of experts using top-k routing, optimizing resource usage.
- **Load Balancing**: Includes a load-balancing loss to ensure uniform token distribution across experts.
- **Residual Connections and Layer Normalization**: Enhances model stability and performance.

## Installation

To use this model, ensure you have Python 3.7+ and PyTorch installed. You can install the necessary dependencies using:

```bash
pip install torch
```

## Usage

To integrate the Switch Multi-Query Attention Transformer into your project, you can instantiate and use the model as follows:

```python
import torch
from experimental.new_models.switch_attn import Transformer

# Define model parameters
vocab_size = 1000
d_model = 64
num_heads = 8
num_experts = 4
num_layers = 2

# Create a Transformer instance
transformer = Transformer(d_model=d_model, num_heads=num_heads, num_experts=num_experts, num_layers=num_layers, vocab_size=vocab_size)

# Prepare input data
x = torch.randint(0, vocab_size, (2, 16))  # Example input tokens

# Forward pass
output = transformer(x)
print(output)  # Output logits
```

## API Reference

### Classes

- **`MultiQueryAttention`**: Implements multi-query attention with rotary positional embeddings.
- **`SwitchMultiQueryAttention`**: Routes tokens to multiple experts and computes attention with load balancing.
- **`Block`**: Combines attention and feed-forward networks with residual connections.
- **`Transformer`**: Full transformer model with multiple layers of attention and feed-forward blocks.

### Methods

- **`forward(x, attn_mask=None)`**: Computes the forward pass of the model.

## Examples

To run an example, you can use the provided script in the repository:

```bash
python examples/main.py
```

This script demonstrates how to initialize the model, process input data, and obtain predictions.
